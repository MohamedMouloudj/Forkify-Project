Recipe application allows users to search/upload recipes!

There are over 1M recipe to search, and you can even add yours with full control (create,upload,remove).
## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to implement my new learned architecture (MVC) and apply almost everything I have learned in Javascript, before moving to another technology.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

- HTML
- SASS
- JAVASCRIPT
  - OOP
  - MVC architecture (model-view-controller)
  - asynchronous code
  - Locale storage

## Contributing

I wrote this code with the help of ***Jonas Schmedtman***.I continued the work and I added some functionalities such as : 

- Clearing all the bookmarks with one click.
- Removing the created recipe from the page and from the database.
- User can add ingredients while creating the recipe as much as he wants.
